    Hi, I’m Tulay but my family and close friends in Turkey just call me Tüliş (Tulish). London’s been home for the past nine years and if I’m honest, I travel mainly for the food, the culture, and all those stories that happen along the way. I always come back from holiday with something funny or a bit embarrassing to share and my friends eventually convinced me to put it all online. I’ve tried to write a blog before but aiming for perfect made it stressful so this time it’s just me telling things as they are.

    One of my favourite travel memories is from Madrid. I was at Doverxo and the chef gave everyone a little story with each dish. One course was inspired by a sandwich his dad used to make. It was not fancy but with the story, suddenly, it tasted like something special. That’s what I love about food, the effort, the meaning, and the memories behind it.
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 1.1em 0;line-height:1.5;">
    I would love to organise small food trips in the future for five people at most to eat, explore, and create some good memories together. Meeting new people and hearing their stories is the best part of travelling, right up there with dessert.

  I sometimes co-parent a dog called Luna when her humans are away and she keeps life interesting and full of cuddles.

    If you have got a craving or a dream meal, let me know. Maybe I will take you there or you can join one of my future adventures and see how travel meets taste.

    During the day I am a QA Engineer at Moneybox. I have been testing software for thirteen years but now I am also testing the best places to eat. Priorities. :)
